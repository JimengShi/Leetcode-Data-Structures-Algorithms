# Why we set condition 2?
# If we do not set condition 2, the final output would be [[1,1,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,2],[1,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,1,1]] which can be considered as the output of Problem 46. In other words, the second 2 is considered it's different with the first 1. Therefore there is a double here. The solution to solve this is we need to skip the second 1 when we have already used the first 1.


# Time: O(N x N!). Initially we have N choices, and in each choice we have (N - 1) choices, and so on. Notice that at the end when adding the list to the result list, it takes O(N).
# Spaceï¼šO(N x N!). Since we have N! solutions and each of them requires N space to store elements.
